# Adventure_Works_Dashboard_AdventureWorks
Guided Power BI project featuring interactive dashboards for sales, profit, returns, and customer analysis using the AdventureWorks dataset.


Project overview

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the AdventureWorks dataset. It was completed as a guided project during a Power BI course, following step-by-step instructions from the instructor. All report building, calculations, and analysis were performed and understood by me independently.
The project demonstrates my ability to analyze business data, build meaningful KPIs, and present insights through clear and interactive visualizations.


Business questions addressed

The dashboard answers key business and analytical questions, including:
How are revenue, profit, and orders performing over time?
Which product categories and products generate the most revenue?
What is the return rate, and which products are returned most often?
How does performance compare to targets?
Which regions and countries drive the highest sales?
Who are the most valuable customers?
